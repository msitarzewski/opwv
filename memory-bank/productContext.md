# Product Context

## User Goals
1. **Instant Immersion**: Animation starts immediately on page load
2. **Natural Evolution**: Motion feels organic and evolving, not repetitive or chaotic
3. **Gentle Interaction**: Mouse/touch creates visible but subtle responses
4. **Distraction-Free**: No UI elements to interrupt the experience

## User Stories (MVP)

## Market Context
- **Category**: Generative art / Interactive visualization
- **Comparable**: Processing/p5.js sketches, creative coding experiments, ambient digital art
- **Differentiation**: WebGL performance + Three.js ecosystem + zero-config experience

## Acceptance Criteria
