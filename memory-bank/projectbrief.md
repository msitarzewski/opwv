# Project Brief: Organic Particle WebGL Visualizer (OPWV)

## Vision
Create a mesmerizing, browser-based generative art experience that renders full-screen organic particle animations using WebGL and Three.js. Every load produces a unique, beautiful visual that feels alive and intentional.

## Mission
Deliver an effortlessly beautiful, interactive particle system that runs smoothly at 60fps on modern hardware, requiring zero configuration from the viewer.

## Core Goals
1. **Generative Beauty**: Create visually stunning animations that are different every time (seeded randomness)
2. **Organic Motion**: Particles that feel alive — flocking, drifting, swirling with natural fluidity
3. **Subtle Interaction**: Mouse/touch creates gentle influence without disrupting the experience
4. **Performance**: Smooth 60fps on desktop, graceful degradation on mobile
5. **Immediacy**: Animation starts instantly, no loading screens or UI clutter

## Target Audience
- Art/design enthusiasts seeking digital beauty
- Viewers who appreciate generative/computational art
- Users looking for calming, ambient visual experiences

## Success Metric
The animation should be something a user **wants to leave running** — like art on a wall.

## Scope (MVP)
**Timeline**: 2-4 days
**Deliverable**: Single animation mode with mouse/touch interaction, no UI controls

## Non-Goals (MVP)
- Multiple animation modes
- UI controls/settings panels
- Audio-reactive support
- Server components/backend
- Save/share functionality
