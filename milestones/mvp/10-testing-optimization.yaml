title: Testing and Final Optimization
phase: MVP
priority: high
estimated_duration: 2hr
status: completed

description: |
  Test the complete system across devices, optimize performance, fix bugs,
  and ensure all acceptance criteria are met for MVP release.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Page loads and animation starts within 1 second
  - 60fps sustained on modern desktop browsers
  - Graceful performance on mobile devices
  - Every refresh produces different, pleasing animation
  - Mouse and touch interaction working smoothly
  - No console errors or warnings
  - No memory leaks (verify with Chrome DevTools)
  - All PRD acceptance criteria verified

tasks:
  - Test on desktop browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
  - Test on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
  - Verify load time (< 1 second on broadband)
  - Test with various seeds for visual quality
  - Check for memory leaks (run for 5+ minutes, monitor memory)
  - Optimize bundle size (verify Vite production build)
  - Profile performance (Chrome DevTools Performance tab)
  - Fix any identified bugs or performance issues
  - Verify all PRD acceptance criteria
  - Clean up console.log statements (keep seed logging only)

technical_notes: |
  - Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab for profiling
  - Check Memory tab for leaks (heap snapshots)
  - Verify Three.js object disposal (no orphaned geometries/materials)
  - Test with throttled CPU/network in DevTools
  - Verify mobile touch interactions (not just mouse)
