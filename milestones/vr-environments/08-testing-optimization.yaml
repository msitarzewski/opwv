description: |
  Comprehensive VR testing, performance profiling, comfort assessment, and final
  optimization for V1 release. Ensure all environments, UI, and features work
  flawlessly in VR. Create testing documentation and production readiness report.

acceptance_criteria:
  - All environments tested in VR (Meta Quest 2/3 minimum)
  - 72fps maintained across all environments
  - Spatial UI comfortable and readable
  - Speed control works smoothly in all environments
  - Environment transitions polished and comfortable
  - No motion sickness triggers identified
  - Landing page tested on desktop/mobile
  - Bundle size optimized (<600kB)
  - TESTING-V1.md created with comprehensive test coverage
  - Production readiness sign-off

tasks:
  - Test all 5-7 environments in VR (Quest 2/3)
  - Profile performance of each environment (Chrome DevTools)
  - VR comfort assessment (motion sickness checklist)
  - Test spatial UI (gaze selection, controller selection)
  - Test speed control in all environments
  - Test environment transitions (all pairs)
  - Test landing page on desktop/mobile browsers
  - Cross-device testing (Quest, desktop VR, other headsets)
  - Bundle size optimization (tree-shaking, minification)
  - Final code review and cleanup
  - Create TESTING-V1.md documentation
  - User testing with 3-5 VR users
  - Production build verification
  - Create production readiness report

dependencies:
  - vr-01 (Environment System Architecture)
  - vr-02 (VR-Only Migration)
  - vr-03 (Spatial UI Framework)
  - vr-04 (Speed Control System)
  - vr-05 (Environment Presets)
  - vr-06 (Landing Page)
  - vr-07 (Environment Transitions)

  VR Testing Checklist:

  Environment Testing (Per Environment):
  - [ ] Loads successfully in VR
  - [ ] Maintains 72fps (5+ minute session)
  - [ ] No visible jitter or stuttering
  - [ ] Particles render correctly (no clipping, z-fighting)
  - [ ] Colors are vibrant and comfortable
  - [ ] Spatial layout feels immersive
  - [ ] No motion sickness after 10 min session
  - [ ] Adaptive quality triggers correctly if FPS drops

  Spatial UI Testing:
  - [ ] Cards visible and readable at 4 units distance
  - [ ] Gaze selection works (crosshair + dwell time)
  - [ ] Controller selection works (laser pointer + trigger)
  - [ ] Hover states provide clear feedback
  - [ ] Card animations smooth (no judder)
  - [ ] Text legible (font size, contrast)
  - [ ] Menu toggle works (show/hide)
  - [ ] UI maintains 72fps when visible

  Speed Control Testing:
  - [ ] Slider responds to gaze/controller input
  - [ ] Speed changes affect particle motion in real-time
  - [ ] Smooth transitions between speeds
  - [ ] Preset buttons work (0.5x, 1.0x, 1.5x, 2.0x)
  - [ ] Speed persists across sessions (localStorage)
  - [ ] Performance stable at all speeds (72fps)

  Transition Testing (All Environment Pairs):
  - [ ] Fade to black smooth and comfortable
  - [ ] No flashing or jarring changes
  - [ ] Loading state displays correctly
  - [ ] New environment initializes properly
  - [ ] Cancel function works mid-transition
  - [ ] Maintains 72fps during transition
  - [ ] No motion sickness triggers

  Landing Page Testing:
  - [ ] Displays correctly on desktop Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge
  - [ ] Displays correctly on mobile (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
  - [ ] Responsive layout works (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - [ ] Images load quickly (<2s on 3G)
  - [ ] "Enter VR" button works correctly
  - [ ] Browser compatibility info accurate
  - [ ] Headset info accurate and up-to-date
  - [ ] Accessibility: keyboard navigation, screen reader support

  Performance Profiling:
  - Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
  - Record 60s session per environment
  - Analyze frame timing, CPU usage, memory
  - Identify bottlenecks (rendering, JS, GC)
  - Optimize hot paths

  Bundle Size Optimization:
  - Current: ~476kB (120kB gzipped)
  - Target: <600kB (<150kB gzipped)
  - Tree-shaking: Remove unused Three.js modules
  - Minification: Terser with aggressive options
  - Code splitting: Lazy load environments (optional)
  - Asset optimization: Compress textures, remove debug code

  Motion Sickness Assessment:
  - Session duration: 10+ minutes per environment
  - Tester feedback: Comfort rating (1-10)
  - Check for: Nausea, dizziness, eye strain, disorientation
  - Causes: Low FPS, rapid motion, camera movement, visual conflict
  - Mitigations: Stable FPS, smooth transitions, stationary camera

  User Testing Protocol:
  - Recruit 3-5 VR users (varied experience levels)
  - Provide test script (environment switching, speed control, UI)
  - Observe sessions, take notes
  - Collect feedback survey (Likert scale + open-ended)
  - Iterate on issues found
